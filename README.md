# AlgorithmsAssignmentClosestPairOfPoints
This was a homework Assignment for an a Graduate Level Algorithms Class

//STILL NEED TO COMPLETE

Assignment:

Implement the algorithm for the closest pair of points (Section 33.4 in
the textbook). Your algorithm should input the coordinates of the points in
the point-set from a text file whose format matches the test files uploaded
on D2L, and output (1) the coordinates of a closest pair in the point-set,
and (2) the distance between the two points in the closest pair.
You can use any standard programming language (C, C
++, C#, Java,
Python, etc.). Please test your code on the test files in D2L (located in
the same folder of Dropbox), and compare your solutions to the provided solutions (same folder).
